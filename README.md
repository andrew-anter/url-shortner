### How to run it

The application depends on python 3.12 without any external pip packages thus
the installation process is only configuring the virtual environment then run
the main.py file after editing it to use the proper url-shortner function from
functions.py

```bash
uv sync
uv run main.py

```

The application uses uv python package and procject manager.
